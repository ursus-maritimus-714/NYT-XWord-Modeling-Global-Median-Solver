# Predictive Modeling of "Global Median Solver" (GMS) Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle

## Introduction

### Project Overview and Data Sources
This summary reports on the results of predictive modeling of "Global Median Solver" (GMS) performance over 6+ years (Jan. 2018 - early Feb. 2024) of the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Previously, I conducted a [comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of GMS performance](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Global-Median-Solver?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) over this sample period. From this EDA, numerous features pertaining to both the puzzles themselves as well as to the past performance of the GMS were identified as candidate features for predictive modeling of GMS solve times (GMSTs).    

This project relied crucially on two amazing data sources. The first, [XWord Info: New York Times Crossword Answers and Insights](https://www.xwordinfo.com/), was my source for data on the puzzles themselves. This included a number of proprietary metrics pertaining to the grids, answers, clues and constructors. XWord Info has a contract with NYT for access to the raw data underlying these metrics, but I unfortunately do not. Therefore, I will not be able to share raw or processed data that I've acquired from their site. Nonetheless, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with all of my Python code for analysis and figure generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-Modeling-Global-Median-Solver/tree/main/notebooks). The second, [XWStats](xwstats.com), was my source for historical GMS raw solve time data. From these raw solve times for each puzzle, XWStats (Matt) calculates global median solve times (GMSTs). Thus, the GMS is a composite of many different individuals who just so happened to fall at the 50th percentile on (at least) one particular puzzle's solve time distribution. Per personal communication with Matt, most puzzle dates have somewhere between 1-2K individual solver solve times recorded (with consent from each individual solver). I do *not* have the underlying raw data for solvers in the database apart from that for two experienced solvers, both of whom were also subjects of similar EDA analyses; [Individual Solver 1(IS1)](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-1/blob/main/README.md) and [Individual Solver 2(IS2)](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-2/blob/main/README.md) Both of these individual solvers will also be carried through predictive modeling in the near future as well.

### Overview of NYT Crossword and GMS Characteristics
The NYT crossword has been published since 1942, and many consider the "modern era" to have started with the arrival of Will Shortz as (only) its 4th editor 30 years ago. A new puzzle for each day is published online at either 6 PM (Sunday and Monday puzzles) or 10 PM (Tuesday-Saturday puzzles) ET the prior evening. Difficulty for the 15x15 grids (Monday-Saturday) is intended to increase gradually across the week, with Thursday generally including a gimmick or trick of some sort (e.g., "rebuses" where the solver must enter more than one character into one or more squares). Additionally, nearly all Sunday through Thursday puzzles have themes, some of which are revealed via letters placed in circled or shaded squares. Friday and Saturday are almost always themeless puzzles, and tend to have considerably more open constructions and longer (often multiword) answers than the early week puzzles. The clue sets tend to be more wordplay heavy/punny as the week goes on, and the answers become less common in the aggregate as well. Sunday puzzles have larger grids (21x21), and almost always feature a wordplay-intensive theme to which the longest answers in the puzzle pertain. The intended difficulty of the Sunday puzzle is approximately somewhere between a tough Wednesday and an easy Thursday. 

**Figure 1** shows dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 23 grid, clue and answer-related features obtained from XWord Info. This analysis demonstrates that, while puzzles from a given puzzle day do indeed aggregate with each other in n-dimensional "puzzle property space", the puzzle days themselves nonetheless exist along a continuum. Sunday is well-separated from the other puzzle days in this analysis by PCA1, which undoubtedly incorporates one or more grid size-contingent features.

*<h5>The first 3 principal components accounted for 47.6% of total variance. All puzzles from Jan. 1, 2018- Feb. 10, 2024 were included in this analysis (N=2,232).*
###
The overlapping distributions in GMSTs in the solve time density plot in **Figure 2** show a parallel performance phenomenon to the continuum of puzzle properties seen in **Fig. 1**; namely that while solve difficulty increased as the week progressed, puzzle days of adjacent difficulty had substantially overlapping GMST distributions. Other than for the "easy" days (Monday and Tuesday), distributions of GMSTs were quite broad. Wednesday and Saturday also had somewhat multimodal solve time distributions, supporting the notion that there were "easy" and "hard" puzzle pools/constructors at the level of specific puzzle days. The broadness of each puzzle day-specific GMST distribution over the entire sample timeframe depicted here (2018-2024) was also increased by the fairly dramatic improvement in GMS performance over those 6+ years. The temporal dynamics of this improvement will be highly evident in the next section's figures.     

One additional contextual note about the GMS is worth mention upfront. Though Matt from XWStats uses the word "global", and I adopt it as well, it is highly likely that the sample from which the GMST is pulled per puzzle skews faster than the true population distributions. The reasons for this assumption are twofold; only solvers who actually complete a given puzzle are included in its sample, and each sample contains only solvers motivated enough by the prospect of improvement to track their own progress to begin with.

### Key Outcomes from the GMS EDA
One of the most important findings from the EDA as far as implications for predictive modeling was that the GMS demonstrated marked improvement over the course of the sample period across all puzzle days (**Figure 3**). Coupled to the fact that puzzle day-specific, decay-time weighted recent past performance was highly positively correlated to performance on the next puzzle both overall (r=.86) and across puzzle days (**Figure 4**), this created an imperative to explore and potentially include different variants of this feature type in the predictive modeling stage.

###
Along with the recent performance baseline (RPB) discussed above, multiple features pertaining to the puzzles themselves demonstrated moderately strong or strong correlations with GMS performance on individual puzzles (**Figure 5**). Two that stood out in particular for their correlational strength with GMS performance were 'Average Answer Length' (upper right panel) and 'Freshness Factor' (lower right panel), the latter of which is a proprietary XWord Info measure of the rareness of a given answer in the NYT puzzle. The density plots on the right hand side (below each correlation scatterplot) show that the distributions of these features that were highly correlated to GMST (for all 15x15 puzzles: r=.69 and .70, respectively) were well-separated across puzzle days. This is an important property for candidate predictive features to have since, as is shown in **Fig. 2**, distributions of solve times for individual puzzle days were themselves well-separated.

## Methods

### Predictive Feature Generation
For predictive feature generation, all puzzles issued by NYT from Jan. 1 2018-Feb. 10, 2024 (N=2,232) were included. The right panel of **Figure 6** summarizes predictive features included at the outset of the modeling stage (N=38) by broad class. A few key example features from each class are mentioned below. **Supplementary Table 1** comprehensively lists out, classifies and describes all included features.  

* 'Solver Past Performance Features' (n=9) included a subset (3) of features capturing short- (decay time-weighted mean of the 10 puzzle day-specific puzzles immediately prior to a given puzzle being predicted on), intermediate- (same, but prior 25 puzzles) or long-term (same, but prior 40) GMS past performance. The left panel of **Fig. 6** depicts schematically the time-decay weighting of this feature subset. A number of temporal integration windows and decay curves were tested in univariate linear models for short-, intermediate- and long-term features, and smooth decay-weighting (e.g., 40,39,38,37...) yielded the best predictions. Later testing wih the full feature set revealed, however, that predictions were slightly better when including *only* long-term features from this class. Thus, the ultimate 'Best Model' included only smooth decay-weighted, long-term GMS past performance features ('GMS_RPB_l40' and 'GMS_RPB_l40_stdev'; see Discussion for commentary on this subject).
 
* 'Puzzle: Clue or Answer Features' (n=19) included 'Freshness Factor', which measured the aggregate rarity of answers in a given puzzle across all NYT crossword puzzles from before or since the issue date. This class also included other measures of answer rarity, including the number of entirely unique answers in a puzzle ('Unique Answer #') and the 'Scrabble Score', which assigns corresponding Scrabble tile values to each letter in an answer (rarer letters = higher tile values, hence a different angle at assessing answer rarity). On the clue side of the ledger, this class also included a count of the frequency of wordplay in clues for a given puzzle ('Wordplay #'). Later week puzzles contained more such clues, and early week puzzles often contained very, very few. 

* 'Puzzle: Grid Features' (n=11) included both the number of answers ('Answer #') and 'Average Answer Length' in a given puzzle. As puzzles got more difficult across the week, the former tended to decrease and the latter tended to increase. This class also included 'Open Squares #', which is a proprietary measure of XWord info capturing white squares not bordered by black squares (tended to increase as puzzles increased in difficulty across the week). This category also included features capturing other design principles of puzzles, including 'Unusual Symmetry'. This feature captured puzzles deviating from standard rotational symmetry (e.g., those with left-right mirror or diagonal symmetry), that could have had implications for their difficulty.  

* 'Puzzle Day' (n=1) was a class of one, simply assigning a number to the puzzle day of week for a given solve.

### Machine Learning Regression Modeling 
For the modeling phase, puzzles from the first year of the sample period were removed to minimize the potential effects of baseline performance volatility (see EDA linked in Intro and **Fig. 3**). This reduced the overall sample size to N=1,867. Importantly, as they were generated prior to this filtering, 'Solver Past Performance Features' included in modeling accrued from the beginning of 2018. Additonally, for the main model 21x21 puzzles (Sun) were also removed from the sample. This resulted in a final modeling 15x15 puzzle N=1,601. The 21x21 puzzles (N=266) were, however, included in by-puzzle-day modeling (see **Figure 8**). 

After predictive features were generated for each puzzle, the best regression model for prediction of the TF (raw GMS solve time, in minutes) was found ('Best Model'). To find 'Best Model', 4 different regression models were explored using [scikitlearn (scikit-learn 1.1.1)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_1_1_0.html): Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and HistGradient Boosting. For evalaution of models including all 15x15 puzzles, a 75/25 training/test split (1,200/401 puzzles) and 5-fold training set cross-validation were used. Additionally, hyperparameter grid search optimization was used per model as warranted (for ex., for Gradient Boosting the grid search was conducted for imputation type, scaler type, learning rate, maximum depth, and maximum features). 'Best Model' (ie, lowest RMSE training error when hyperparameter-optimized) was a Linear Regression model. See the 'Model Metrics' csv files in the 'Reporting' folder for details, including how this model performed relative to the other models). Also, see **Supplementary Figure 1** for some details on the performance of 'Best Model' (ie, Data Quality Assessment, K-best features selection, and Feature Importances).

## Key Modeling Results

**1)** 'Best Model' predicted the TF (raw GMS solve time, in minutes) more accurately than did a univariate linear model with puzzle day-specific (PDS), mean Global Median Solver (GMS) solve time *across the entire sample period* as the sole predictive input ('Mean PDS GMST'). 'Best Model' also outperformed a variant that simply guessed the mean of the training set TF, *across all 15x15 puzzle days*, for each individual puzzle ('Dummy').(**Fig. 7**). The 'Full Model' mean training error of 3.87 minutes, which corresponded to a 23.7% difference from the training set mean across all 15x15 puzzle days. In contrast, the 'Mean PDS GMST' and 'Dummy' benchmark models had mean training errors of 4.37 and 8.11 minutes, respectively (corresponding to 26.7% and 49.7% differences from the training set mean).

*<h5> 'Best Model' was a Linear Regression Model (K-best features = 23).*

**2)** When individual feature classes or adjustments were systematically subtracted in the modeling stage ('Subtraction Analysis'), subtraction of 'Past Performance Features' resulted in by far the largest increase in model error relative to 'Best Model' (10.8%). The second largest increase in model error came with subtraction of the 'Answer Features' class (1.6%). Each other feature class or adjustment subtracted from 'Best Model' resulted in a <1% increase in model error. **Figure 8** shows, in decreasing order of negative impact on model prediction quality, the effect of removing individual feature classes or adjustments (decay time-weighting; hatched bar) from the full 'Best Model'.    

**Figure 8. Effect on Model Prediction Quality of Removing Individual Feature Classes or Adjustments from the Best Model**

Because subtraction of 'Past Performance Features' resulted in substantial reduction in prediction quality, a subanalysis looked at the impact of removing individual features from this class. 'Past Performance Features' included time-decay weighted GMS performance on the immediately previous 40 puzzle day-specific puzzles ('GMS_RPB_l40'), time-decay weighted standard deviation of RPB ('GMS_RPB_l40_stdev'), normalized past performance against the constructor(s) of a given puzzle ('GMS Past Perf vs Constr'), and number of past solves on both a puzzle day-specific and non-puzzle day-specific basis ('Prior Solves # - DS' and 'Prior Solves # - NDS', respectively). The left panel of **Figure 9** shows that removal of no single feature was responsible for the bulk of the large increase in model error with the removal of *all* features from this class (10.8%). Removal of recent performance baseline ('GMS_RPB_l40') and normalized past performance vs the constructor(s) of a given puzzle being predicted ('GMS Past Perf vs Constr') each resulted in 1.4% increases in model training error. Removal of the other features in this class each resulted in an increase of model error of <1%. 

The individual removal of two other features (**Fig. 9**; right panel) resulted in increases in model error comparable to that seen with removal of individual 'Past Performance Features'. Removal of 'Freshness Factor' (and two percentile derivitives) resulted in a 1.1% increase in mean training error compared to 'Best Model'. 'Freshness Factor' is a proprietary XWord Info measure that assesses the aggregate relative novelty of all answers in a given crossword puzzle as compared to those in all other crossword puzzles in the NYT archive. 'Wordplay #' is a somewhat subjective measure of clues that I manually evaluated and calculated clue-by-clue across (nearly) the entire puzzle sample completed by the GMS. Removal of this feature increased model training error by .6%. Apart from these features and those pictured in the left side of **Fig. 9** the removal of no other individual feature of any class increased model error by >.5%.     

**Figure 9. Effect on Model Prediction Quality of Removing Key Individual Features**

###
**3)** 'Best Model' was discovered on a puzzle day-specific basis (BPDM), including for the lone 21x21 puzzle day Sunday (**Figure 10**). Because GMS mean solve time per puzzle day varied considerably, training errors in **Fig. 10** were normalized to percentage difference from training set mean for that puzzle day. The 'Dummy' model in this puzzle day-specific context is analogous to the 'Mean PDS GMST' benchmark model in **Fig. 1**, as the 'Dummy' for all 15x15 puzzles guessed the *overall sample mean* for each puzzle regardless of puzzle day. 

Though the number of puzzles included in the BPDMs (N=266; +- 1) was much smaller than that in the all 15x15 puzzles model, each still outperformed its particular (not so dumb) 'Dummy'. However, high performance variability on later week puzzle days (Fri and Sat) can be seen in standard deviations that overlap with 'Dummy' model performance. Sunday (18.6% mean BPDM training error) and Monday (15.3%) stood out as the two most predictable individual puzzle days, with the other puzzle days ranging between 21-23% mean training error for BPDM. Finally, it is also worth noting that despite the much smaller sample size, each BPDM outperformed the all 15x15 puzzle days 'Best Model' (23.7%; see **Fig. 1** and associated text) on a % of mean solve time basis.

*<h5> BPDM for each day was a Linear Regression Model, with hyperparameter optimization specific to that puzzle day. Due to the relatively small number of puzzles in the sample for each puzzle day, an 80/20 training/testing split was used to find each BPDM (213/54 +-1 puzzles for each puzzle day). Data Quality Assessments for each BPDM were inconclusive regarding sufficency of number of puzzles included.* 

## Discussion

#### *Challenge of modeling the Global Median Solver (GMS)*
The availability of both historical solve times (XWord Stats) and numerous metrics of the puzzles themselves (NYT XWord Info) provided the crucial synergy needed to make a serious run at modeling solver performance. For this first variant of the modeling exercise I chose to model the performance of a not a single human solver, but rather of a mathematical entity; GMS. It's very important to state upfront of any interpretation of the results of this exercise that a big part of the challenge of modeling the GMS, as opposed to modeling individual solvers, is that the sequence of solves for the GMS was *not* explicitly known. I had to make the inference that the median solver for each puzzle solved puzzles in *approximately* the sequence in which they were issued. This assumption is a big deal because, based on exploratory data analysis I previously conducted on the GMS and two individual solver for whom I *did* have completion timestamps for each puzzle, I already knew that recent past performance was going to be an extremely important concept to capture in predictive modeling. While the results support the assumption of approximate (see below) sequential solving as being correct, there are also clearly reasons to believe that having the raw underlying data for the GMS including completion timestamps would yield even more accurate predictions of solve times.

#### *Best Model for all 15x15 puzzles outperformed benchmarks* 
The main result of this study was that the full 'Best Model', incorporating both GMS past-performance features as well as numerous features capturing different aspects of individual puzzle grid, clue and answer properties, outperformed several benchmark models. 'Best Model' greatly outperformed (by ~4 minutes on average) a 'Dummy' model, which guessed the total 15x15 puzzles sample mean solve time for each individual puzzle. This is unsurprising, since different puzzle days included in the modeling set have distinct solve time distributions and peaks. More encouraging that this modeling approach is on the right track is that 'Best Model' also (by ~.5 minutes on average) outperformed a model which guessed the sample mean of the *specific puzzle day* for each individual puzzle. This validates the assumption that solving was in *approximately* the order of puzzle issue sequence, and also shows that accounting for recent solver for as well as indivudual puzzle parameters is important for prediction. 

#### *For Best Model, GMS past performance features were more important than puzzle-specific features*
Another clear finding of this study was that, as a class, 'Past Performance' results had a considerably larger impact on prediction quality than did any other class. Removing this class entirely (subtraction analysis) resulted in a >10% increase in training error (~.5 minutes on average) compared to 'Best Model', while removal of the second most impactful class 'Answer Features' resulted in ~2% increase in training error. In golf terms, the recent playing form of the golfer was a lot more important than the specific characteristics of the course being played. With that said, it is critical to point out that 'Past Performance' features themselves had puzzle-day specific information built into them. 'Recent Performance Baseline' (RPB), for example, was specific to the puzzle day of the puzzle being predicted. Thus, because "courses" per puzzle day tend to have similar characteristics, many puzzle features themselves may have been somewhat redundant to information carried by RPB. The inverse was clearly not true, however, as puzzle characteristics do not carry any "memory" of how an individual performed relative to their values in the past. 

#### *Features capturing recent solver form, history vs constructor(s), and aggregate rarity of answers mattered most to prediction quality*
Interestingly, 'Past Performance vs Constructor(s)' and 'RPB' had nearly equal impacts on training error; removal of either reduced prediction quality by ~1.5%. The implication here is that there are idiosyncratic elements to individual constructor(s) that capture variables important to solvers that are not captured either by solver general form or the quantified measures of puzzles present as features in this study. The quantified past performance with many constructors in this sample goes back as early as the beginning of 2018 as well, which in many cases is well earlier than the proven optimal integration window for 'RPB' (40 previous day-specific puzzles). Furthermore, 'Past Performance vs Constructor(s)' was normalized in such a way that it controlled for both RPB at the time of a given solve *and* for the hereogeneity of puzzle days for a given constructor(s) past puzzles. Thus, something valuable for prediction is being isolated that is robust to both recent soler form and the inherent differences between puzzle days. The only other feature that came close to having as much impact on prediction quality as those in the 'Past Performance' class was 'Freshness Factor' (removal increased training error by ~1.1%). This is a proprietary XWord info feature that captures the aggregate rarity of answers in a given puzzle. This feature was identified in the EDA as a strong candidate for predictive value, as its distribution across puzzle days was well separated in a way that aligned with GMS solve time distributions across puzzle days. Furthermore, strong positive correlations with GMSTs were seen both across all 15x15 puzzle days and within each puzzle day. 

#### *Day-specific models were difficult to interpret, but a larger sample per puzzle day could yield superior model accuracy* 
Unequivocally the most difficult to interpret result of the study was the by puzzle day-specific modeling (BPDM). The obvious reason for this difficulty is the greatly reduced sample size (1/6) of each puzzle day relative to the full 15x15 data set employed in generating 'Best Model' (training set sizes of ~215 instead of ~1,200). To this point, relatively large standard deviations can be seen in **Fig. 10**, and these standard deviations were particularly large for the more heterogenous and more difficult later week puzzle days. Also, though Monday and Sunday appeared to have distinctly higher quality predictions than the other puzzle days, guessing just based on day-specific sample mean ('Dummy') was also proportionately more accurate for those puzzle days than the others. This implies greater homogeneity of puzzle characteristics for those two days relative to the others that led to generally more clustered solve times. Clearly more data would be a great boon to this approach, a fact backed up by the Data Quality Analysis for 'Best Model', where model quality didn't level off until training set sizes ~600 (see **Fig. S1**). 

It is interesting to point out with regard to the BPDMs, however, that despite small sample sizes each of these puzzle day-specific models was *more* accurate than the all 15x15 puzzles 'Best Model' in terms of training error as a percentage difference from sample mean (~21-23% training error vs ~24%). The likely explanation is that, though inadequately powered, each day-specific model contained only puzzles with properties/features highly relevant to those in the puzzle under prediction. On the flip-side, it's likely that the cross-days heterogeneity of puzzles included in the all 15x15 puzzles model added algorithmic challenge even as the increased sample size helped model convergence to a somewhat counterbalancing degree. A reasonable way to "have cake and eat it too" here would be to have a median-type solver complete many hundreds of puzzles appropriate for individual puzzle days within a reasonably short timeframe (say, months) and then either model them separately or perhaps cluster Mon-Wed in an "easy" model and Thu-Sat in a "hard" model. The main challenge to the first approach would be to accurately model RPB with an unusual rate of solving, and the main challenge to the latter would be that each puzzle day truly does have its own idiosyncracies (and splitting the sample in half probably doesn't help overcome that).

#### *What's Missing?*
As alluded to in the first section of this Discussion, the lack of completion timestamps for the GMS presents a big problem for model prediction quality given that 'recent performance' was determined to be extremely important. To this end, it should be noted that removal of time-decay weighting (see hatched blue bar in **Fig. 8**) had virtually no effect on model quality. In stark contrast, such removal had a large negative effect on model quality for two individual solvers (IS1 and IS2) whom I *did* have completion timestamps for and was thus able to create features caculated off of the true sequence (and also factoring in the time interval between) of past solves (stay tuned for links to modeling summaries for both of these solvers). Obtaining these data for the GMS would allow a reconstruction of the solve timeline for the GMS, though the caveat here is that the identity of the GMS changes every time new solver data are added to an old puzzle. 

Of the different types of puzzle-specific features, the one I easily find most lacking is Clues. We saw how the Answer feature 'Freshness Factor' was important for model quality. What I'd like to find or create myself is an analogous feature on the Clue side to get at the unusualness of words within the clues. One can imagine puzzles where the 'tough' words are in the clues not in the answers, and this would be missed to some extent by the current feature set. Also on the Clue side simply quanitfying 'Average Clue Length' would be quite useful. It stands to reason that the more reading a solver must do to know what to answer, the slower the solve will be. There are also several other types of cross-classification trickiness in puzzle design that would be hard to quanify, but I think worth a shot at doing so. One of these I call 'Answer Ambiguity', which arises when there is more than one plausible answer in an unfilled piece of grid for a given clue. My strong sense as an experienced solver myself is that this is a a wheel spin-inducing art form wielded more by some constructors than others, and more typically on later-week puzzle days. There's also another concept that I call 'Design Isolation', where the details of the construction give a solver fewer 'outs' in a tough corner of a puzzle than they'd otherwise have. I don't quite think current features like 'Unusual Symmetry', 'Cheater Square #', or 'Open Squares' are capturing this in a useful way.  

Finally, I'd like to point out that unlike other prediction projects I've carried though (most notably my [men's tennis match prediction project](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/Mens-Tennis-Prediction?tab=readme-ov-file#readme), I have hardly dabbled in the space of 'features derivitives'; the taking of 'primary' features and combining them in various ways (for ex. creating ratios of puzzle parameters to other puzzle parameters) in hope that one or several just 'click' for a particular model algorithm. That process can be extremely time consuming (the many hundreds of hours I spent on the tennis project attest to that), but also very fruitful and often so in ways that are unexpected going into the modeling stage of a project.

*<h5> Note: this is the complete set of features included at the outset of predictive modeling, but some were removed through the iterative process that led to 'Best Model' for all 15x15 puzzles selection. See Methods for details.*

*<h5> The Linear Regression Model yielded 'Best Model', out of the 4 tested. See the Model Metrics file in Reporting folder for full details. Panel A shows K best features selection for 'Best Model' based on mean CV score (k=23). Panel B shows the feature importances for the k best features in 'Best Model'. See Table S1 above for descriptions of these features, and also for those not selected. Panel C shows a Data Quality Assessment for best model. It appears that model quality leveled off well short of the number of samples used in the all 15x15 puzzles training set (n=1200).*
